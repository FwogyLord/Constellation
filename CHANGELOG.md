- **ContainerScreenAccessor** mixin: leftPos/topPos for screen overlays
- **Auto-scraper**: `/cn scrape <mode>` + passive auto-scrape (sidebar, entities, GUI, chat, actionbar)
- **Generic ConfigScreen builder**: auto-discovers boolean fields for all 14 constellations
- **HubScreen**: responsive grid layout with descriptions, scroll, toggle switches

### Bug Fixes
- ActionBar k/M/B suffix parsing (was showing 20/3 instead of actual HP)
- Star mob detection: checks custom name, display name, AND entity name
- Bat animation filter: skips bats near coal/clay/terracotta (door materials)
- Chat format: shortenCoins only rebuilds Component when numbers actually change
- Etherwarp: long-range 61-block raycast, filled block, red=invalid
- HubScreen: vertical overflow → responsive grid with scroll
- Hypixel § color codes: strip ChatFormatting before matching rare-drop/level-up patterns
