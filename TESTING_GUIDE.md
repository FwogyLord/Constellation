# Constellation testing guide

You do not need to test everything in one sitting. Start with the five-minute check, then test one game-area session whenever you naturally play that area. Checkboxes are intentionally split into small groups.

## Garden plot prices

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Plot Price Helper`.
2. Enter the Garden and open `Configure Plots`.
3. Allow several seconds for Bazaar and Auction prices to load.

### Test

- [ ] Open Configure Plots. Expected: a side panel ranks fully priced locked plots from cheapest to most expensive.
- [ ] Hover a locked plot. Expected: each recognized material line gains its coin value and the tooltip shows the complete plot total.
- [ ] Inspect a multi-material cost. Expected: every material is priced and included exactly once.
- [ ] Keep Show Owned enabled. Expected: tooltip rows compare inventory plus observed sack quantities against each requirement.
- [ ] Hold enough required materials. Expected: the tooltip reports affordability and optional green highlighting appears.
- [ ] Enable Cheapest Highlight while unable to afford the cheapest plot. Expected: only the cheapest fully priced plot receives the configured yellow highlight.
- [ ] Run `/plotprices rows 3`. Expected: the panel shows no more than three plots plus the optional visible-total row.
- [ ] Disable Inline, Total, Panel, Visible Total, Owned, Affordable, Cheapest and Affordable Highlight independently. Expected: only the corresponding presentation changes.
- [ ] Wait for a missing market price to load. Expected: the plot appears automatically after the next refresh.
- [ ] Present a cost with an unknown material or unavailable price. Expected: that plot is omitted rather than shown with a partial total.
- [ ] Click a locked plot manually. Expected: Constellation does not block, modify or generate the click.

## Pesthunter shop profit

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Pesthunter Profit`.
2. Enter the Garden and open the exact `Pesthunter's Wares` menu.
3. Allow several seconds for Bazaar and Auction prices to load.

### Test

- [ ] Open Pesthunter's Wares. Expected: a side panel ranks fully priced offers by estimated profit per Pest spent.
- [ ] Hover a ranked output. Expected: its tooltip shows output value, material cost, trade profit, Pests required and profit per Pest.
- [ ] Compare two trades with different Pest costs. Expected: ranking uses profit divided by Pests, not raw trade profit.
- [ ] Enable Best Highlight. Expected: only the highest-ranked visible offer receives a green advisory outline.
- [ ] Enable Positive Only. Expected: losing and zero-profit offers disappear.
- [ ] Run `/pestshop rows 3`. Expected: no more than three offers appear while the ranking remains correct.
- [ ] Disable Item Price, Materials, Profit, Pests and Per Pest independently. Expected: only the corresponding tooltip line disappears.
- [ ] Reopen the shop after prices refresh. Expected: ranking updates without restarting or changing a menu item.
- [ ] Present an offer with an unresolved material, output ID or required price. Expected: it is omitted rather than priced as though the missing component were free.
- [ ] Click a normal trade manually. Expected: Constellation neither blocks nor synthesizes the click.

## Visitor Logbook analytics

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Visitor Logbook Stats`.
2. Open the exact `Visitor's Logbook` menu in the Garden.
3. Keep Persistent enabled if totals should survive restarts and profile changes.

### Test

- [ ] Open the first Logbook page. Expected: a side panel shows visited, accepted, denied, acceptance rate, waiting visitors and captured pages.
- [ ] Navigate through every page once. Expected: each page is captured without double-counting visitors; completion turns green only after the final page or an explicit total is proven.
- [ ] Reopen an already captured page. Expected: unchanged values do not accumulate or create duplicate visitors.
- [ ] Leave visitors waiting in the Garden queue. Expected: the total denied count subtracts the authoritative current queue where Hypixel exposes it.
- [ ] Hover a real visitor entry. Expected: its tooltip adds accepted, denied and acceptance-rate values.
- [ ] Run `/visitorlog option sortdenied on`. Expected: ranking switches from most visited to most denied.
- [ ] Run `/visitorlog rows 3`. Expected: at most three visitor ranking rows appear while summary rows remain.
- [ ] Disable Visited, Accepted, Denied, Rate, Queue, Pages, Top and Tooltips independently. Expected: only the selected presentation changes.
- [ ] Disable Persistent, run `/visitorlog reset`, and revisit one page. Expected: only the current session is retained.
- [ ] Switch profiles. Expected: captured visitors and pages restore only for the active profile.
- [ ] Run `/visitorlog reset`. Expected: only the current profile is cleared. Use `resetall` only to deliberately clear every saved profile.

## Anita medal shop

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules, `Anita Helper`, `Anita Medal Profit` and `Anita Extra Farming Fortune`.
2. Visit Anita and open the inventory named exactly `Anita`.
3. Allow a few seconds for Bazaar and Auction prices to load.

### Test

- [ ] Open Anita. Expected: a side panel ranks valid shop outputs by estimated profit per Bronze-equivalent medal.
- [ ] Hover one ranked output. Expected: its tooltip shows estimated sale value, non-medal cost, profit per trade, Bronze-equivalent cost and profit per Bronze Medal.
- [ ] Compare a Gold, Silver and Bronze offer. Expected: medal conversion uses 8, 2 and 1 Bronze medals respectively.
- [ ] Enable Best Highlight. Expected: only the highest-ranked visible offer receives a green advisory outline.
- [ ] Enable Positive Only. Expected: zero-loss and losing offers disappear from the panel.
- [ ] Run `/anitahelper rows 3`. Expected: the panel shows at most three ranked offers.
- [ ] Find Extra Farming Fortune and hover it. Expected: the tooltip learns the current profile's tier and shows remaining Gold Medals and Jacob's Tickets through tier 15.
- [ ] If tier learning cannot identify changed Hypixel lore, run `/anitahelper tier <0-15>`. Expected: the tooltip immediately uses the recovery tier without clicking or buying anything.
- [ ] Change profile and reopen Anita. Expected: the saved Fortune tier does not leak between profiles.
- [ ] Disable individual Sale, Materials, Trade Profit, Bronze, Tier, Remaining and Ticket Value options. Expected: only the corresponding tooltip lines disappear.
- [ ] Present an offer with an unrecognized non-medal material or missing price. Expected: that offer is omitted rather than shown with inflated profit.

## Garden Rare Crop Tracker

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Rare Crop Tracker`.
2. Enter the Garden holding a recognized farming tool.
3. Run `/rarecrops` to confirm the tracker is on and using the session or profile view you want.

### Test

- [ ] Receive any `RARE CROP!` or `VERY RARE CROP!` farming drop. Expected: its exact type and count appear once in the movable Rare Crops HUD.
- [ ] Enable Hide Chat and receive another drop. Expected: only that exact rare-crop message is hidden; the HUD still increments.
- [ ] Run `/rarecrops add burrowing_spores 2`. Expected: two local recovery/test entries are added without sending a server command.
- [ ] Toggle Session off. Expected: the current profile's saved totals appear; changing SkyBlock profiles does not leak totals.
- [ ] Stop harvesting for longer than the configured AFK delay. Expected: active uptime and profit/hour stop advancing until harvesting resumes.
- [ ] Toggle Profit, Profit Per Hour, Uptime and Recent independently. Expected: only their HUD rows change.
- [ ] Run `/rarecrops price purchase`, then `/rarecrops price sell`. Expected: value uses Bazaar purchase cost and sell return respectively.
- [ ] Set `/rarecrops lines 2`. Expected: at most two drop-type rows show while summary rows remain.
- [ ] In Crop Money, toggle Rare Crops while wearing zero, one, two, three and four eligible armor pieces. Expected: the relevant crop's hourly value changes only when at least two eligible pieces produce a nonzero drop chance; later armor tiers count for earlier drops.
- [ ] Run `/rarecrops reset`. Expected: session totals clear but profile totals remain. Run `/rarecrops clear` only when you want to erase this profile's totals.

## Garden Level progression

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Garden Level Display`.
2. Enter the Garden and open either the Desk or SkyBlock Menu once.
3. Keep Overflow enabled to show levels above 15.

### Test

- [ ] Open the Desk and inspect its center Garden item. Expected: `/gardenlevel` reports the same level and total XP represented by its lore.
- [ ] Open the SkyBlock Menu. Expected: slot 10 synchronizes the same profile without creating a second value.
- [ ] At level 15 or higher, hover the Garden item. Expected: the tooltip adds current overflow XP, next-level progress and percentage without replacing Hypixel lore.
- [ ] Accept a visitor that rewards Garden Experience. Expected: total and current-level XP increase once by the displayed reward.
- [ ] Cross an overflow level boundary. Expected: optional local level-up chat appears once and its text can be clicked to run `/gardenlevels`.
- [ ] Disable Overflow. Expected: level caps at 15 while earned XP remains saved and can optionally be shown as overflow.
- [ ] Toggle Progress, Percentage, Total XP and Overflow XP independently. Expected: only the selected HUD rows remain.
- [ ] Toggle Roman numerals and change `/gardenlevel precision 2`. Expected: level formatting and percentage precision update immediately.
- [ ] Switch SkyBlock profiles and open the Desk. Expected: each profile restores only its own Garden XP.
- [ ] Run `/gardenlevel clear`. Expected: only the current profile is forgotten and the display asks for a Desk sync.

## Garden crop money per hour

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Crop Money Display`.
2. Keep `Crop Money Use Custom Bps` off to learn each crop from farming, or enable it and set `/cropmoney bps 2000` for a 20.00 BPS comparison.
3. Enable at least one of Sell Offer, Instant Sell or NPC.

### Test

- [ ] Farm one crop for at least five seconds. Expected: its observed BPS is saved and its row appears once true Farming Fortune has been seen for that crop.
- [ ] Compare the current row with Bazaar prices. Expected: hourly profit changes after Bazaar refresh and the current crop is yellow.
- [ ] Toggle Bountiful, Mooshroom, Merge Seeds and Rare Crops separately. Expected: only the relevant contribution or rows change.
- [ ] Set the top count below the current crop's rank. Expected: Show Current adds that crop without hiding a higher-ranked crop.
- [ ] Run `/cropmoney option manual on`, then `/cropmoney position melon 1` and `/cropmoney position wheat 2`. Expected: those crops hold the first two manual positions even when prices change.
- [ ] Assign two crops the same position. Expected: both remain visible and use profit as the stable tie-breaker.
- [ ] Run `/cropmoney resetpositions`. Expected: saved positions clear; automatic profit ordering resumes after `/cropmoney option manual off`.
- [ ] Leave the Garden. Expected: the HUD hides immediately even when Always On is enabled.
- [ ] Open `/cn hud` while the display was visible in the last five seconds and scroll it. Expected: the crop-money HUD can be moved and resized like other current HUD elements.

## Before testing

1. Launch the `Constellation Gather 26.2` Prism instance.
2. On the title screen, open Mods and confirm Constellation is present.
3. Join Hypixel SkyBlock.
4. Run `/cn config`.
5. Enable only the constellation you are about to test. This avoids duplicate overlays from your other installed mods.
6. Search within that constellation for the named feature and enable its parent toggle first, then its child options.
7. Run `/cn hud` only while the relevant HUD is visible. Drag it where you want it and hover-scroll to resize it.
8. If something is wrong, run `/cn scrape all` in the affected area and keep the generated file from `config/constellation-scrapes/`.

## Five-minute smoke test

- [ ] Open `/cn config`. Expected: the screen opens without disconnecting or freezing.
- [ ] Toggle Apollo on, then off. Expected: its HUD appears and disappears without needing a restart.
- [ ] Open `/cn hud`. Expected: the game remains visible beneath a slightly opaque overlay; there are no decorative panels or borders.
- [ ] Hover a visible HUD and scroll. Expected: only that HUD resizes.
- [ ] Drag a visible HUD, close the editor, reopen it. Expected: position and scale persist.
- [ ] Run `/cn scrape all`. Expected: a local confirmation and a new diagnostic file.
- [ ] Change islands once. Expected: no stale world boxes, labels or timers remain from the previous island.

If all seven pass, the shared framework is healthy. Continue with whichever area you actually play.

## Jacob contest history and planning: test this release first

### Import contest history

1. Enable Hercules and `Jacob Contest History`.
2. Open Jacob's exact `Your Contests` menu and browse several pages.

- [ ] Expected: only menus whose slot 50 identifies the bulk farming-contest claim control are accepted.
- [ ] Each contest item should contribute its crop and available Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze thresholds.
- [ ] Close and reopen the menu. Expected: records remain for the current profile.
- [ ] Switch profiles. Expected: neither records nor learned BPS values leak between profiles.
- [ ] Run `/jacobhistory status`. Expected: it reports the target bracket and current-profile record count.

### Medal planner and hovered details

- [ ] Open `Your Contests` with Time Needed enabled. Expected: the movable Jacob Medal Planner lists crops ordered against the selected bracket using the newest configured sample count.
- [ ] Run `/jacobhistory bracket gold` and `/jacobhistory samples 10`. Expected: the planner recalculates from the latest ten matching records.
- [ ] Enable custom BPS and run `/jacobhistory bps 19.9`. Expected: every time and FF estimate uses exactly 19.9 blocks per second.
- [ ] Disable custom BPS and farm each crop. Expected: the planner uses learned profile/crop BPS, with 19.9 as a safe missing-data fallback.
- [ ] Hover a historical contest item. Expected: the planner switches to that exact contest's five known thresholds and Farming Fortune requirements.
- [ ] Toggle thresholds, FF, impossible results and missing rows independently. Expected: only the selected presentation remains.
- [ ] Compare FF values with the latest true Farming Fortune display. Expected: crop-specific values are used and missing FF is reported, never invented.

### Summaries and Personal Bests

- [ ] Complete or leave a Jacob contest after farming. Expected: the summary uses locally validated harvests for total blocks and BPS, plus participation time and the last observed crop score according to enabled rows.
- [ ] Enter a contest without breaking a matching crop. Expected with Hide Zero enabled: no empty summary is sent.
- [ ] Change contest crops. Expected: the old crop summary closes and the new crop measurement starts cleanly.
- [ ] Trigger the three Personal Best chat lines. Expected: one local message reports the gained crop Fortune after all three values arrive.
- [ ] Toggle overflow handling. Expected: values beyond the normal 100-Fortune cap use the licensed overflow calculation only when enabled.
- [ ] Run `/jacobhistory clear`. Expected: only the current profile's historical records clear.
- [ ] Verify menu clicks and server communication remain unchanged.

## Upcoming Jacob contests

### Schedule and HUD

1. Enable Hercules, `Jacob Upcoming Display` and `Jacob Upcoming Fetch Automatically`.
2. Enter SkyBlock and run `/nextcontest refresh`.

- [ ] Expected: the movable Next Jacob Contest HUD shows exactly three upcoming crops and a start countdown from the current EliteSkyBlock schedule.
- [ ] During an active contest, expected: the row changes to Active and counts down to the contest end.
- [ ] In the Garden, compare the boosted marker in the tab widget. Expected: Boosted names the matching crop and prefixes it with `*` in the crop list.
- [ ] Enable following contests and set the following count. Expected: one to five later contests appear in timestamp order.
- [ ] Enable the schedule source row. Expected: the fetched SkyBlock year appears.
- [ ] Disable outside-Garden display and leave the Garden. Expected: the HUD hides; enabling it restores the same persisted countdown.
- [ ] Restart before the next automatic fetch. Expected: up to 40 future contests load immediately from cache without waiting for the network.

### Warnings and recovery

- [ ] Enable upcoming warnings and set `/nextcontest warning 120`. Expected: one warning occurs within two minutes of a selected contest and never repeats for that contest.
- [ ] Toggle a crop with `/nextcontest warncrop <crop>`. Expected: contests containing only disabled crops do not warn.
- [ ] Set `/nextcontest message Farming Contest soon: {crops} in {time}`. Expected: `{crops}`, `{time}` and optional `{boosted}` resolve from live data.
- [ ] Toggle title, chat, sound and window attention independently. Expected: each channel follows its own setting; window attention only requests attention when unfocused.
- [ ] Disable automatic fetching and run `/nextcontest refresh`. Expected: deliberate refresh still works.
- [ ] Run `/nextcontest clear`. Expected: cached contests clear without affecting live contest progress or other Garden data.
- [ ] Disconnect during a fetch or simulate a failed request. Expected: no crash, no partial schedule replacement, and the last valid cache remains.
- [ ] Verify no server command, click, movement or gameplay packet is generated.

## Garden Composter

### Resource and inventory overlay

1. Enable Hercules, `Composter Helper` and `Composter Overlay`.
2. Enter the Garden and wait for the Composter tab widget to appear.
3. Open the `Composter` inventory.

- [ ] Expected: a side panel shows Organic Matter, Fuel, selected fill materials, required quantities, market costs, Stored Compost, estimated empty time and profit per compost.
- [ ] Compare Organic Matter and Fuel with the tab widget and inventory bars. Expected: values match, including decimal and `k`/`m` formatting.
- [ ] Enable sack counts after opening the corresponding sacks. Expected: known counts appear beside the selected materials; unknown counts remain omitted rather than guessed.
- [ ] Toggle round-down. Expected: fill amounts change between conservative floor and complete-fill ceiling quantities.
- [ ] Inspect slots 13, 46 and 52. Expected: compact Stored Compost, Organic Matter and Fuel numbers render only in this exact menu.

### Upgrades, persistence and alerts

- [ ] Open `Composter Upgrades`. Expected: available `Click to upgrade!` entries receive a gold highlight.
- [ ] Hover an upgrade with item costs. Expected: its tooltip adds the combined known market cost and excludes Copper.
- [ ] Close the menu and run `/composter status`. Expected: learned upgrade levels affect capacity, cost reduction, speed and multi-drop profit calculations.
- [ ] Enable the Composter display and move it in `/cn hud`. Expected: the Garden HUD shows current resources and empty time.
- [ ] Enable outside-Garden display, then leave the Garden. Expected: only the persisted empty countdown remains visible.
- [ ] Enable low-resource notifications and set `/composter lowmatter <amount>` or `/composter lowfuel <amount>` above the current value. Expected: one warning occurs and respects the configured cooldown.
- [ ] Enable near-empty warnings. Expected: alerts begin only within the configured threshold and are rate-limited.
- [ ] Switch SkyBlock profiles. Expected: resources and upgrade levels never leak between profiles.
- [ ] Run `/composter clear`. Expected: only the current profile's persisted timer/state clears.
- [ ] Verify all inventory clicks remain unchanged. Expected: the feature only draws and reads data; it never retrieves, buys, clicks or sends a gameplay action.

## Garden farming lanes

### Save a lane

1. Enable Hercules and `Farming Lane Distance Display`.
2. Hold the crop tool you want to configure in the Garden.
3. Run `/farmlane detect`, then farm to the far end of one layer, turn around and travel at least two blocks back.

- [ ] Expected: detection saves the dominant north/south or east/west axis for that crop and profile.
- [ ] Run `/farmlane status`. Expected: it reports the crop, direction and two measured bounds.
- [ ] For manual placement, stand at one end and run `/farmlane start <crop> <northsouth|eastwest>`, then stand at the other end and run `/farmlane end <crop>`. Expected: that specific crop receives the two new bounds.
- [ ] Run `/farmlane set <crop> <direction> <min> <max>`. Expected: exact numeric bounds can also be assigned manually.
- [ ] Configure a second crop. Expected: switching held tools selects each crop's own saved lane.

### Guidance and controls

- [ ] Farm within a saved lane. Expected: the movable Farming Lane HUD reports remaining distance and ETA toward the end you are approaching.
- [ ] Pause, move very slowly, then resume normal speed. Expected: Paused, Too slow and Calculating replace ETA until speed stabilizes.
- [ ] Approach the end within the configured warning time. Expected: enabled title/chat channels fire once and the sound repeats at its configured interval.
- [ ] Use `{crop}`, `{distance}` and `{time}` in the message. Expected: each variable resolves to live lane data.
- [ ] Enable corner waypoints. Expected: both bounds render at the player's current cross-axis position; disabling them removes all world markers.
- [ ] Run `/farmlane ignore <crop>`. Expected: missing-lane reminders toggle only for that crop.
- [ ] Run `/farmlane clear <crop>`. Expected: only that profile and crop's lane is removed.
- [ ] Leave the Garden or disconnect. Expected: the HUD, notifications and world markers stop immediately, while saved lanes remain.
- [ ] Verify movement and turns remain manual. Expected: the feature never changes movement, aiming, clicks or packets.

## Garden DNA Analyzer

### Board recognition and solution

1. Enable Hercules and `DNA Analyzer Solver`.
2. Open any Garden DNA Analyzer board.

- [ ] Wait for all 36 colored DNA slots to load. Expected: the next two manually clickable slots receive distinct green/cyan highlights labelled 1 and 2.
- [ ] Compare every column. Expected: the solver activates only when each column contains red, green, blue and yellow exactly once.
- [ ] Click the two highlighted slots manually. Expected: the board update is rescanned and a new minimum-swap pair is highlighted.
- [ ] Continue until complete. Expected: the HUD counts remaining swaps down and shows Solved when no swap remains.
- [ ] Close and reopen the board. Expected: all previous board state resets and the new board is solved independently.
- [ ] Open an unrelated inventory whose title does not end in ` DNA`. Expected: no highlights, tooltip changes, click blocking or HUD.

### Configuration and safeguards

- [ ] Toggle numbered order, board darkening, HUD and hidden tooltips separately. Expected: each visual behavior changes independently.
- [ ] Change first, second and non-selected ARGB colors. Expected: only the corresponding overlay color changes.
- [ ] Disable end-column swaps. Expected: the solver treats the first and last columns as fixed; restore it afterward because the current live rule allows end swaps.
- [ ] Click slot 49 with close protection enabled. Expected: the accidental close action is blocked with local feedback.
- [ ] Enable wrong-click blocking and click a non-highlighted DNA slot. Expected: the click is swallowed and optional feedback explains why.
- [ ] Disable wrong-click blocking. Expected: all board clicks remain fully manual and pass through normally.
- [ ] Run `/dnasolver status` and `/dnasolver option <name> <on|off>`. Expected: state is reported and supported options persist.
- [ ] Verify ordinary left-clicks are still ordinary clicks. Expected: Constellation never rewrites them to middle click and never sends a solver click itself.

## Garden hoe levels

### Level and progress

1. Enable Hercules and `Hoe Level Display`.
2. Hold a specialized farming tool with `levelable_lvl` and `levelable_exp` data in the Garden.

- [ ] Compare the displayed level and tool XP against the item. Expected: current/next level and XP threshold match.
- [ ] Switch to an ordinary item. Expected: the Hoe Level HUD disappears immediately.
- [ ] Leave the Garden while holding the tool. Expected: the display and sound filter stop.
- [ ] Toggle level, progress, percentage, remaining, XP rate, ETA, upgrade and wrong-crop rows independently. Expected: only the chosen rows appear.
- [ ] Gain tool XP. Expected: XP/min and ETA stabilize from actual item-data deltas, then return to Waiting after the configured inactivity reset.
- [ ] Farm a crop that does not match the held specialized tool. Expected with Wrong Crop enabled: a red warning appears.

### Upgrades, overflow and sound

- [ ] Let XP exceed the current threshold before upgrading. Expected: Upgrade Required appears below level 40 and Overclock Required appears from level 40 onward.
- [ ] Trigger a normal hoe level-up with sound muting enabled. Expected: only the exact portal-travel level-up sound is suppressed; unrelated portal sounds remain.
- [ ] At level 50, trigger a Tool Exp Capsule overflow message. Expected: the message gains the resulting level and that profile/tool UUID gains one overflow level.
- [ ] Switch profiles or tools. Expected: overflow values do not leak between profiles or UUIDs.
- [ ] Disable overflow display. Expected: tracked overflow remains saved but is not added to the visible level.
- [ ] Run `/hoelevel status`. Expected: it reports level, XP, overflow state and sound state.
- [ ] On a level-50 tool, run `/hoelevel set 55`, then `/hoelevel reset`. Expected: the visible overflow level changes deliberately and then returns to its base.
- [ ] Try setting overflow on a tool below level 50 or without a UUID. Expected: it is rejected without modifying another tool.

## Garden crop milestones

### Initial synchronization

1. Enable Hercules and `Crop Milestone Progress`.
2. Enter the Garden and run `/cropmilestone sync`.
3. Keep the `Crop Milestones` menu open briefly.

- [ ] Inspect all 13 crop items. Expected: their exact `Total` values are learned for the current profile.
- [ ] Hold a crop-specific tool after closing the menu. Expected: the Crop Milestone HUD shows that crop, its current and target tiers, progress, ETA/rates when available, and no other crop.
- [ ] Run `/cropmilestone status`. Expected: it reports the same crop, tier, counter and remaining amount.
- [ ] Switch SkyBlock profiles and synchronize again. Expected: each profile retains independent counters and goals.

### Live tracking and display

- [ ] Farm with a Cultivating or counter-bearing tool. Expected: the saved milestone counter rises from actual tool-counter deltas and the measured crops/second stabilizes.
- [ ] Farm Wheat. Expected: seed-inclusive Cultivating deltas are converted to Wheat milestone progress instead of overcounting.
- [ ] Stop for the configured reset time. Expected: rate becomes zero and ETA says Waiting without losing progress.
- [ ] Toggle tier, progress, percentage, ETA, crops/second, crops/minute, crops/hour and blocks/second rows. Expected: every row changes independently.
- [ ] Change `Crop Milestone Row Order`. Expected: valid row names reorder the HUD without changing the underlying values.
- [ ] Enable Show Without Tool, farm briefly, then change slots. Expected: the last actively farmed crop can remain visible; disabling it restores held-tool-only behavior.

### Goals and warnings

- [ ] Run `/cropmilestone goal wheat 46`. Expected: Wheat progress and ETA target the absolute cumulative Tier 46 requirement.
- [ ] Enable Max Tier. Expected: crops without a higher custom goal target Tier 46 instead of only the next tier.
- [ ] Run `/cropmilestone cleargoal wheat`. Expected: Wheat returns to the configured next/max-tier behavior.
- [ ] Use `/cropmilestone set wheat <counter>` only as a recovery test, then reopen Crop Milestones. Expected: the menu restores the authoritative server total.
- [ ] Enable close warning, title and sound with a deliberately reachable goal. Expected: one warning occurs inside the configured final seconds and does not repeat for the same target.

### Crop Milestones menu

- [ ] Reopen Crop Milestones with inventory tiers and average enabled. Expected: every recognized crop has a tier number and the menu shows the average across all 13 crops.
- [ ] Toggle inventory overflow. Expected: displayed tiers cap at 46 when disabled and may exceed it when enabled.
- [ ] Hover a crop item with total-progress tooltip enabled. Expected: progress percentage and exact current/required totals to Tier 46 appear before Rewards.
- [ ] Leave the Garden. Expected: HUD, menu additions and tracking all stop immediately.

## Garden commands

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Garden Commands`.
2. In Minecraft Controls, confirm `Garden Home` is Caps Lock, `Garden Set Home` is Left Alt and `Garden Barn` is unbound unless you choose a key.
3. Keep `/home`, `/barn`, `/tp <plot>` and their desired hotkey toggles enabled.

### Commands and hotkeys

- [ ] In the Garden, run `/home`. Expected: Hypixel receives `/warp garden` and returns you to the Garden spawn.
- [ ] Run `/barn`. Expected: Hypixel receives `/tptoplot barn`.
- [ ] Run `/tp 3`, then test a named plot if you use one. Expected: the complete text after `/tp` is sent through `/tptoplot`.
- [ ] Press Garden Home with no screen open. Expected: it sends `/warp garden` exactly once.
- [ ] Press Garden Set Home with no screen open. Expected: it sends `/setspawn` exactly once.
- [ ] Bind and press Garden Barn. Expected: it sends `/tptoplot barn` exactly once.
- [ ] Hold a hotkey, open chat/inventory while pressing it, and close the screen. Expected: no repeat and no delayed command after the screen closes.
- [ ] Leave the Garden and repeat the shortcuts. Expected: hotkeys do nothing and the normal server interpretation of typed commands is preserved.
- [ ] Disable each command and hotkey option separately. Expected: only that shortcut stops.
- [ ] Enable hotkey feedback and change the cooldown. Expected: deliberate key actions show local confirmation and rapid duplicate inputs respect the configured delay.
- [ ] Run `/gardencommands` and `/gardencommands option <name> <on|off>`. Expected: saved status and supported option names are shown without sending a gameplay command.

## Garden mouse sensitivity

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Mouse Sensitivity Helper`.
2. In Minecraft Controls, bind `Garden Sensitivity` if N is unsuitable.
3. Keep auto-enable off for the first manual checks.

### Manual controls

- [ ] Run `/sensreduce`. Expected: camera movement becomes 10% of normal, the Mouse HUD shows `10%`, and Minecraft's sensitivity option does not change.
- [ ] Run `/sensreduce` again. Expected: normal camera movement returns and the HUD disappears.
- [ ] Run `/farmmouselock`. Expected: mouse movement cannot rotate the player, but movement keys and menus still work.
- [ ] Teleport to another Garden plot. Expected with release mode Always: rotation unlocks and a local status message appears.
- [ ] Press the Garden Sensitivity key. Expected: it toggles the configured reduced or locked state without repeating while held.

### Automatic controls

- [ ] Enable auto activation and Tool mode, then hold a crop-specific farming tool on a Garden plot. Expected: sensitivity lowers only while the tool and location conditions match.
- [ ] Walk into the Barn. Expected with Only Plot enabled: automatic reduction stops.
- [ ] Jump. Expected with On Ground enabled: automatic reduction stops while airborne and resumes within the configured ground tolerance.
- [ ] Test optional rod, vacuum, mousemat, Sprayonator and Sun's Grasp modes separately. Expected: only enabled held-item modes activate.
- [ ] Enable Lock Mouse. Expected: automatic modes lock rotation instead of reducing it.
- [ ] Change the percentage, ground tolerance, HUD, chat, mousemat lock and teleport release settings. Expected: each behaves independently and persists after restart.
- [ ] Leave the Garden. Expected: automatic state and its HUD disappear; a deliberate manual state remains until toggled, teleported or disconnected.

## Garden crop locations

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Crop Location Helper`.
2. Keep mode `START`, auto-learn, start box, labels and per-profile storage enabled to match the live profile.
3. Hold a crop-specific farming tool in the Garden.

### Manual per-crop starts

- [ ] Stand at the intended beginning of a farm and run `/cropstart set`. Expected: the held tool’s crop receives a start point at your current block.
- [ ] Without changing tools, stand elsewhere and run `/cropstart set wheat`. Expected: Wheat receives that manually chosen location independently of the held tool.
- [ ] Repeat with compact multi-word crop names such as `/cropstart set netherwart`, `sugarcane`, `wildrose` and `cocoa`. Expected: each specific crop is accepted.
- [ ] Switch between those tools. Expected: only the held crop’s saved start waypoint is shown.
- [ ] Run `/cropstart clearstart wheat`. Expected: only Wheat’s manual start is removed; its last-farmed position and other crops remain.

### Learning and modes

- [ ] Clear one crop, hold its matching tool and break a valid crop block outside the Barn. Expected: its first valid local harvest automatically saves a start point once.
- [ ] Continue farming. Expected: the last-farmed point follows your position without repeatedly moving the original start.
- [ ] Stop and walk at least ten blocks away, then select Last mode. Expected: a purple last-farmed waypoint appears with a beam.
- [ ] Return to farming. Expected: the last waypoint hides while it is being continuously updated and reappears after you leave again.
- [ ] Select Both mode. Expected: start and last-farmed points display together with distinct labels and colors.
- [ ] Disable auto-learn. Expected: new start points are not created, but existing starts remain and last-farmed tracking still works.
- [ ] Enter the Barn or break a crop without its matching tool. Expected: neither action learns a crop location.

### Configuration and persistence

- [ ] Toggle start/last boxes, start/last beams, line, labels, distance and wall visibility independently. Expected: only the selected primitive changes.
- [ ] Change start/last colors, box size, beam height, render range and last-point activation distance through `/cropstart`. Expected: settings persist.

### Farming Toolkit crop icons

- [ ] Enable Hercules and run `/toolkiticons`. Expected: status reports Toolkit crop icons on.
- [ ] Open the exact `Farming Toolkit` menu. Expected: farming tools in slots 10-16 and 20-24 render as their crops; unrelated items and player-inventory slots remain unchanged.
- [ ] Hover every replaced icon. Expected: the original farming-tool name and lore remain available because the real slot item is not replaced.
- [ ] Hold a crop-specific farming tool before opening the menu. Expected: the matching crop icon receives a green outline when held highlighting is enabled.
- [ ] Run `/toolkiticons option labels on`. Expected: compact crop abbreviations appear, including distinct NW, SC, SF, MF and WR labels.
- [ ] Test `/toolkiticons option background off`, `decorations on`, `highlight off` and `/toolkiticons color held FF55FFFF`. Expected: each presentation setting changes independently and persists.
- [ ] Click, shift-click and close the menu normally. Expected: no click is blocked, rewritten or generated.

### Garden rod-break protection

- [ ] Enable Hercules, enter the Garden and run `/norodbreak`. Expected: protection and the default sneak bypass report on.
- [ ] Hold any vanilla-based SkyBlock fishing rod and left-click a crop or solid block without sneaking. Expected: the block does not take damage, no attack packet is sent and the action bar explains the protection.
- [ ] Keep holding attack against the same block. Expected: block-damage progress never begins and feedback is throttled rather than flooding the HUD.
- [ ] Right-click with the rod. Expected: casting and retracting work normally.
- [ ] Attack an entity with the rod. Expected: entity attacks are not changed.
- [ ] Hold sneak and left-click a block. Expected: the deliberate bypass permits normal block interaction when `/norodbreak option sneak on`.
- [ ] Run `/norodbreak option sneak off` and repeat while sneaking. Expected: the block remains protected.
- [ ] Test action-bar, chat and sound options plus `/norodbreak cooldown 0` and `2`. Expected: each feedback channel and throttle persists independently.
- [ ] Leave the Garden and left-click a block with the rod. Expected: Constellation does not cancel the interaction.
- [ ] Run `/norodbreak resetcount`. Expected: only the local session prevention count resets.

### Carrolyn fetch helper

- [ ] Enable Hercules and hover an item whose lore says to bring 3,000 to Carrolyn. Expected: the tooltip offers click-to-navigate help and shows the matching inventory total out of 3,000.
- [ ] Hover an ordinary item. Expected: no Carrolyn lines are added.
- [ ] While outside the Crimson Isle, hold a recognized item and left- or right-click into the world. Expected: the click itself remains normal and chat offers a deliberate `[Warp there]` action.
- [ ] Click the warp action. Expected: `/warp crimson` runs only after your click; navigation remains armed during the island change.
- [ ] On the Crimson Isle, start navigation with the item or `/carrolyn start`. Expected: a magenta box, beam, tracer and distance label point to Carrolyn near `(0, 104, -804)`.
- [ ] Approach within four blocks. Expected: navigation stops and the optional arrival message appears.
- [ ] Run `/carrolyn stop`. Expected: all Carrolyn world guidance immediately disappears.
- [ ] Test tooltip, owned, tooltipwarp, click, warp, box, beam, line, label, distance, throughwalls, autostop, startchat and arrivalchat options independently.
- [ ] Test `/carrolyn range`, `beamheight`, `stopdistance` and `color`. Expected: bounded values persist and affect only this helper.
- [ ] Restart and switch profiles. Expected: locations survive restart and remain separate per profile.
- [ ] Disable per-profile storage. Expected: a separate global layout is selected without deleting profile layouts.
- [ ] Run `clear`, `clearstart`, `clearlast`, `clearall` and `clearprofiles` deliberately. Expected: only the documented crop/scope is removed.
- [ ] Leave the Garden. Expected: every crop-location waypoint disappears immediately.

## Garden custom plot icons: test this release first

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules, `Plot Icons`, `Plot Icon Editor Button` and tooltip help.
2. In the Garden, open the Desk and then `Configure Plots`.
3. Look at the bottom-right chest slot. Expected: a wooden axe marked `OFF` appears without replacing the real server item.

### Edit and persistence

- [ ] Left-click the editor axe once. Expected: it changes to Set mode, the click does not reach Hypixel and the tooltip explains the workflow.
- [ ] Click a non-empty item in your player inventory. Expected: the inventory item does not move and local chat confirms it was selected.
- [ ] Click any unlocked non-Barn plot slot. Expected: its visual icon changes to an exact copy of the selected item, including custom model data.
- [ ] Hover the changed plot. Expected: Hypixel's original plot name and lore remain intact, followed by a short custom-icon note.
- [ ] Click the plot normally after returning the editor to Off. Expected: the original plot action works and Constellation does not block or duplicate the click.
- [ ] Close and reopen Configure Plots. Expected: the custom icon persists while the editor safely returns to Off with no pending item.
- [ ] Restart the client and reopen the menu. Expected: the icon still renders from its saved exact-stack data.
- [ ] Right-click the editor from Off. Expected: it enters Reset mode directly.
- [ ] Click a customized plot in Reset mode. Expected: the original plot icon returns and the server receives no edit-mode click.
- [ ] Switch SkyBlock profiles with per-profile mode enabled. Expected: each profile has an independent icon layout.
- [ ] Disable per-profile mode. Expected: a separate global layout is used without deleting profile layouts.
- [ ] Toggle editor button, chat feedback and tooltip help independently. Expected: saved icons remain visible while only the selected editor assistance changes.
- [ ] Run `/ploticons`, `/ploticons option`, `/ploticons clear` and `/ploticons clearall`. Expected: status is accurate and the selected scope is cleared.
- [ ] Open any other inventory or leave the Garden. Expected: there is no editor axe, custom plot icon or click interception.

## Garden plot-menu status: test this release first

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Plot Menu Highlighting`.
2. Keep current, pests, sprays and locked enabled; pasting is available but disabled by default to match the live profile.
3. Keep letters, counts and tooltip status enabled.
4. In the Garden, open the Desk and then `Configure Plots`.

### Status and priority

- [ ] Inspect the plot you are physically standing in. Expected: its slot has the configured current-plot tint and `C` marker.
- [ ] Open the menu while pests are known in one or more plots. Expected: affected slots use the pest tint and show `P` plus the tracked pest count.
- [ ] Open the menu with active Sprayonator effects. Expected: affected slots use the spray tint and show `S` plus rounded-up minutes remaining.
- [ ] Hover a highlighted plot. Expected: the tooltip states the selected status and active sprays include their type and precise remaining time.
- [ ] Inspect an unpurchased plot. Expected: its lore-derived locked status uses the locked tint and `L`.
- [ ] Enable pasting status while a plot paste is running. Expected: lore-derived pasting status uses its own tint and `PA`.
- [ ] Run `/plotmenu priority pests current sprays locked pasting`. Expected: a current plot with pests now displays the pest status because pests has higher priority.
- [ ] Toggle each status with `/plotmenu option <status> <on|off>`. Expected: only that status changes and all choices persist.
- [ ] Toggle letters, counts and tooltip independently. Expected: the tint remains while each selected detail disappears.
- [ ] Run `/plotmenu color pests FF00FF` and then an eight-digit ARGB value. Expected: the pest tint changes and six-digit values retain the default overlay opacity.
- [ ] Open another inventory or leave the Garden. Expected: no plot status tint or tooltip is drawn.
- [ ] Click plot slots normally. Expected: Constellation never blocks, changes or sends an extra click.

## Farming Fortune: test this release first

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules, `Fortune Helper` and `Fortune Display`.
2. Keep compact mode off, missing warnings visible and Pesthunter bonus display off to match the live profile.
3. In `/widget`, enable the Stats widget plus universal Farming Fortune and latest Crop Fortune.
4. Hold a supported farming tool in the Garden.

### Fortune state and warnings

- [ ] Compare the HUD total with universal plus current-crop Fortune in the Stats widget. Expected: the values match exactly.
- [ ] Switch between farming tools. Expected: the HUD follows the held crop and uses the last saved value until that crop's tab line updates.
- [ ] Break the selected crop. Expected: its fresh total is persisted for later tool switches and restarts.
- [ ] Enable breakdown mode. Expected: universal and crop-specific values appear separately beneath the total.
- [ ] Create four or more effective Garden pests. Expected: the configured reduction row follows the exact 5/15/30/50/75 percent thresholds.
- [ ] Temporarily hide universal Farming Fortune from the Stats widget. Expected: a delayed, repeat-limited warning offers a clickable `/widget` action.
- [ ] Restore universal Fortune but hide latest Crop Fortune, then farm. Expected: the separate crop warning appears after its configured delay.

### Pesthunter bonus

- [ ] Enable the bonus row and obtain a Pesthunter Farming Fortune bonus. Expected: amount and stable remaining time appear.
- [ ] Let it expire or observe `Bonus: INACTIVE`. Expected: enabled chat/title/sound channels fire once.
- [ ] Enable the clickable action. Expected: the chat button deliberately runs either `/call Phillip` or `/tptoplot barn`; nothing runs automatically.
- [ ] Run `/fortune` and its option, missing-delay, title-duration and template controls. Expected: all changes persist.

## Greenhouse growth

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules, `Greenhouse Helper`, `Greenhouse Growth`, harvestable highlighting and water highlighting.
2. Keep the countdown visible outside the Garden and ready chat/sound enabled, matching the live profile's always-available timer behavior.
3. Open the Greenhouse's exact `Crop Diagnostics` menu.

### Timer and diagnostic slots

- [ ] Inspect menu slot 20. Expected: `Next Stage` is parsed into a persistent countdown and the movable Greenhouse HUD appears.
- [ ] Reopen the menu while the timer runs. Expected: the deadline remains stable rather than drifting or repeatedly resetting notification state.
- [ ] Inspect Growth Status. Expected: harvestable is green, unavailable is red, and visible drops/rewards use yellow.
- [ ] Inspect Water Status. Expected: enough-water or no-water-needed lore makes the water bucket green.
- [ ] Put similar items in your player inventory. Expected: only server-menu diagnostic slots receive highlights.
- [ ] Let the cycle become ready. Expected: configured chat/title/sound channels fire once.
- [ ] Leave and return after it becomes ready. Expected: an optional while-away message appears once.
- [ ] Keep an overdue timer beyond `Greenhouse Forget After Minutes`. Expected: it hides and does not produce a stale alert.
- [ ] Toggle `Greenhouse Only When Ready`. Expected: the HUD hides until overdue.
- [ ] Run `/greenhouse` plus its option, warning, forget, title-duration, color and template controls. Expected: all changes persist.

## Stereo Harmony

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules, `Stereo Harmony`, `Stereo Display`, `Stereo Replace Menu Icons` and `Stereo Contest Helper`.
2. Keep `Stereo Always Show` and selection notifications disabled initially, matching the live profile.
3. Start breaking crops briefly so the farming-aware HUD is eligible to appear.

### Selection, display and menu

- [ ] Open Stereo Harmony. Expected: each vinyl entry is visually replaced by its associated crop while its original tooltip and click behavior remain unchanged.
- [ ] During a Jacob contest, inspect the matching crop's vinyl. Expected: the matching inactive entry is green; the playing entry is yellow.
- [ ] Select a vinyl. Expected: the HUD shows its exact vinyl, pest and crop after the menu or vacuum lore updates.
- [ ] Close the menu and keep the vacuum anywhere in your inventory. Expected: the active selection remains synchronized.
- [ ] Stop farming for longer than `farmingResetAfterSeconds`. Expected: the HUD hides unless `Stereo Always Show` is enabled.
- [ ] Select None. Expected: the HUD says `Playing: Nothing`, or hides when `Stereo Hide When None` is enabled.
- [ ] Toggle pest/crop rows independently. Expected: the selected rows disappear without losing active-vinyl state.
- [ ] Enable selection notification channels and change vinyl. Expected: one configurable chat/title/sound alert appears; initial login reconciliation does not alert.
- [ ] Run `/stereoharmony` and its option, color, template and title-duration commands. Expected: every setting persists.

## Garden plot sprays

### Enable

1. Enable Hercules and `Spray Tracker`.
2. Keep `Spray Expiry Notification`, `Spray Expiry Chat`, `Spray Show Not Sprayed` and `Spray Notify While Away` enabled.
3. The live-profile default leaves `Spray Hud` and `Spray New Notification` disabled. Enable them only for the HUD/new-spray checks.

### State and expiry

- [ ] Stand in a non-Barn Garden plot and check the Pests tab widget. Expected: its spray type and remaining time become the saved state for that physical plot.
- [ ] Use the Sprayonator. Expected: the exact plot and spray type are stored for 30 minutes without duplicating Hypixel's message.
- [ ] Enable `Spray Hud`. Expected: the movable HUD shows the current plot's spray and countdown, or `Not sprayed`.
- [ ] Disable `Spray Only Current Plot`. Expected: all known active sprayed plots are listed.
- [ ] Enable `Spray New Notification`, then enter a plot with a newly detected or substantially extended spray. Expected: one configurable local message appears, not one per tab refresh.
- [ ] Let a spray expire. Expected: the configured chat/title/sound channels fire once and include the affected plot names.
- [ ] Leave before expiry and return afterward. Expected: the message says it expired while away when that option is enabled.
- [ ] Use a Portable Washer. Expected: every stored active spray clears immediately.
- [ ] Run `/sprays`, `/sprays option`, `/sprays duration`, `/sprays warning`, and the template commands. Expected: settings persist and status reports the active count.

## Garden pest waypoint

### Enable

1. Run `/cn config`, enable Hercules, then enable `Pest Core` and `Pest Waypoint Enabled`.
2. Leave box, beam, label, distance, plot-middle detection, through-walls and arrival cleanup enabled.
3. Leave line and particle hiding disabled for the first test.
4. Warp to the Garden and hold a vacuum.
5. Run `/pestwaypoint status` if you need to confirm the saved state.

### Track and render

- [ ] Left-click once without sneaking while holding the vacuum. Expected: tracking starts, but no target appears until a valid angry-villager particle trail supplies enough points.
- [ ] Right-click, left-click while sneaking, or left-click with a non-vacuum item. Expected: none starts tracking.
- [ ] Follow a real pest-tracker trail. Expected: a red `Pest Guess` box, beam and distance label appear at the predicted endpoint.
- [ ] Track a trail ending exactly at a plot center. Expected: the marker is yellow and includes `(plot middle)`.
- [ ] Enable `pestWaypointLine`. Expected: a line reaches from the crosshair to the waypoint.
- [ ] Change the target and plot-middle colors in config or with `/pestwaypoint color target RRGGBB` and `/pestwaypoint color middle RRGGBB`. Expected: the marker updates.

### Cleanup and filtering

- [ ] Walk within `pestWaypointArrivalRange` horizontally after the first second. Expected: the waypoint clears.
- [ ] Do not approach it. Expected: it clears after `pestWaypointShowSeconds`.
- [ ] Let the Garden pest total reach zero, leave the Garden, disconnect, or change worlds. Expected: all collected points and the marker clear.
- [ ] Enable `pestWaypointHideParticles`. Expected: only the configured tracker firework, enchant and path particle groups are hidden; other particles remain.
- [ ] Run `/pestwaypoint clear`. Expected: the current path clears without changing settings.

## Garden pest core

### Enable

1. Run `/cn config`.
2. Enable `Hercules`.
3. Enable `pestCore`.
4. Leave `pestFinderHud`, `pestFinderWorld`, `pestTimerHud` and `pestStatsHud` enabled.
5. Keep `pestFinderOnlyWithVacuum` and `pestTimerOnlyWithTool` enabled for the first test.
6. Warp to the Garden.

### Basic state

- [ ] Hold a vacuum. Expected: Pest Finder and Pest Timer HUDs appear if the Pests tab widget supplies state.
- [ ] Stop holding the vacuum. Expected: plot guidance disappears after `pestFinderHoldSeconds`; timer visibility follows its held-tool setting.
- [ ] Run `/pests`. Expected: chat reports total pests, detected plots, cooldown and session statistics.
- [ ] Compare the total and plot list with Hypixel's Pests tab widget. Expected: the values match.

### Spawn

- [ ] Farm until a pest spawn message appears. Expected: a configurable green title and sound play once.
- [ ] If `pestCompactSpawnChat` is off, expected: Hypixel's original message remains and no duplicate local line is added.
- [ ] If `pestCompactSpawnChat` is on, expected: one additional compact local line uses `pestSpawnTemplate`.
- [ ] Hold a vacuum after the spawn. Expected: the infested plot receives a border and a label showing its pest count.
- [ ] Stand inside that plot. Expected: it uses `pestFinderCurrentColor` when `pestFinderCurrentPlotRed` is enabled.
- [ ] Use a custom plot name. Expected: after you visit that plot and its name appears on the scoreboard, later spawn messages resolve it to the correct physical plot.

### Cooldown

- [ ] Compare the timer HUD with Hypixel's Pests widget. Expected: `Ready`, `Max pests`, or the remaining time matches.
- [ ] Enable `pestTimerShowAverage`. Spawn at least twice within `pestTimerAverageTimeoutSeconds`. Expected: an average row appears.
- [ ] Let the cooldown approach `pestTimerWarningSeconds`. Expected: enabled title/chat/sound channels fire once.
- [ ] Enable `pestTimerCustomCooldown` and set a known value. Expected: the local estimate counts from the last detected spawn using that value.

### Kill, drops and profit

- [ ] Kill one pest. Expected: alive count falls, current plot count falls, and the Statistics HUD gains one session kill.
- [ ] Compare the pest name and drop amount with the Hypixel reward message. Expected: last pest/drop and quantities match.
- [ ] Wait briefly if the item's market price was not cached. Expected: profit fills in after price data arrives rather than staying at zero.
- [ ] Change HUD visibility options. Expected: kills, drops, profit, profit/hour and session/lifetime text can be independently hidden.
- [ ] Run `/pests reset`. Expected: session values clear but lifetime values remain.
- [ ] Only when you truly want to erase everything, run `/pests resetall`. Expected: session and lifetime pest statistics clear.
- [ ] Leave the Garden. Expected: borders, finder and timer disappear immediately.

## Garden visitors and farming

### Enable

Enable Hercules, `visitorHelper`, `visitorShoppingList`, `farmingControlHud`, `farmingRateHud` and `jacobContestHud`.

### Test

- [ ] Open a Garden visitor. Expected: requested items, inventory amount, sack amount and prices appear.
- [ ] Hover the accept/refuse choices. Expected: configured profit/reward details and safeguards appear.
- [ ] Try refusing a rare/new visitor. Expected: the configured protection blocks the accidental click; the bypass key deliberately overrides it.
- [ ] Hold each farming tool. Expected: the Control HUD identifies the crop and shows its configured speed and target angle.
- [ ] Break crops. Expected: recent BPS, session BPS, blocks and time update only from your own harvests.
- [ ] Enter a Jacob contest. Expected: crop, collected amount, rate and projected total follow the scoreboard.
- [ ] Leave the Garden. Expected: Garden-only HUDs hide unless their outside-Garden option is enabled.

## Dungeons

### Before a run

1. Enable Orion.
2. Enable the dungeon map, score, secrets, puzzle display and the solvers you want to inspect.
3. Disable overlapping dungeon overlays in other mods for a clean comparison.

## Fishing

### Enable

Enable Hydra, then enable only the tracker/alerts for the fishing area you plan to use. Assign any deliberate keys through Minecraft Controls before testing them.

### Test during normal fishing

- [ ] Cast a rod. Expected: hook/bait HUD follows your own bobber, not another player's.

- [ ] With `wardrobeKeyStyle` set to `HOTBAR`, press each configured hotbar key over slots 1 through 9. Expected: the corresponding visible set is selected once.
- [ ] Run `/wardrobekeys style number`. Expected: the physical number-row keys select sets even if Minecraft hotbar keys were rebound.
- [ ] Run `/wardrobekeys style custom`, then bind Wardrobe Slot 1 through 9 in Minecraft Controls. Expected: keyboard and mouse bindings work and unbound slots show no `Unknown` label.
- [ ] Use the Wardrobe Previous Page and Wardrobe Next Page controls. Expected: A and D click the actual previous/next menu buttons by default, subject to the configured cooldown.
- [ ] Test an empty, locked or unavailable set. Expected: no menu click occurs; the original key is consumed only when `wardrobeConsumeInvalidKeys` is enabled.
- [ ] Press the key for the currently equipped set with `wardrobePreventUnequip` enabled. Expected: it remains equipped and optional local feedback explains why.
- [ ] Disable prevent-unequip and bind Wardrobe Unequip. Expected: the explicit key unequips the active set; ordinary set keys still select their set.
- [ ] Run `/wardrobekeys swap 1 2`, enable the swap option and bind Wardrobe Swap. Expected: the key selects slot 2 when slot 1 is equipped and otherwise selects slot 1.
- [ ] Bind Wardrobe Open. Expected: it deliberately sends `/wardrobe` once when pressed on Hypixel and never opens anything automatically.

- [ ] Preview a message. Expected: variables such as score/player/floor substitute without sending anything.
- [ ] Trigger an enabled party event. Expected: exactly one customized message is sent at the correct time.
- [ ] Use reparty/ready checks. Expected: commands occur only after your explicit command/click/key unless that feature is intentionally configured automatic.

## What to include in a bug report

For each failure, record only these five things:

1. Game area and exact action.
2. Feature name and its enabled settings.
3. What appeared versus what should have appeared.
4. Whether another mod showed the correct result.
5. The newest relevant file from `config/constellation-scrapes/` after `/cn scrape all`.

One issue at a time is ideal. You do not need to retest unrelated sections after reporting a localized parser or overlay problem.
