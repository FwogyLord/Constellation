# Constellation feature overview

This is the readable map of what Constellation currently contains. It is organized by game area so you can find things without reading the development handoff or hundreds of changelog entries.

## Start here

- Open the main menu with Right Shift or `/cn config`.
- Enable or disable an entire area with `/cn toggle <constellation>`.
- Open the transparent HUD editor with `/cn hud`.
- HUD elements only appear in the editor when they are currently useful or were visible during the last five seconds. Hover an element and scroll to resize it; drag it to move it.
- Most individual features have their own toggle and detailed settings inside their constellation.
- Puzzle, combat, movement, and aiming helpers are advisory overlays. They do not click or aim for you.
